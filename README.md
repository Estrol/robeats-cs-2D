This game is currently in *alpha* and is subject to *rapid change*. Features may come and go without prior notice.

# How to contribute

Clone the source code to your local desktop environment via `git clone`. You will then need to set up [Rojo](https://github.com/rojo-rbx/rojo) and [Remodel](https://github.com/rojo-rbx/remodel) to build the game itself along with its associated models.

Currently, the game comes with no songs and will error if you try to run the build produced with `rojo build`. You will need to clone [this repo](https://github.com/RoVSRG/robeats-cs-maps) and run the build script with Remodel, and put the resulting model file into the Workspace.

We accept all bug fixes, regardless of the importance. Feel free to open an issue and we can get you right to work.

If you have any questions feel free to join the Discord server (link above) and ping one of the developers for assistance. We will be more than happy to help you!
